1) Use the adult dataset from Day 1 for all of the following points.

2) Based on the exploration and visualization from yesterday, select what you think is an optimal set of training features. If you think you should bin, combine, remove, or otherwise modify any columns, do so.

3) Your goal is to predict the Income column. Using the rpart library, build a predictive model with the default parameters.

4) Tune your model; be sure to try modifying at least two different parameters. You can see what parameters can be modified using ?rpart.control. Also check out our code samples for examples of parameter tuning.

5) Optimize in turn for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a test set. Do the different models do better at certain metrics? Is one model the best at every metric?
