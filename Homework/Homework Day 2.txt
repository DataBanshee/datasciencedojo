1) Use the wine dataset from yesterday for all of the following points.

2) Based on the exploration and visualization from yesterday, select what you think is an optimal set of training features. If you think you should bin or otherwise modify any columns, do so.

3) Use the randomForest and bst packages to build both a random forest and a boosted decision tree to predict the wine type

4) Tune the random forest and boosted decision tree models using the Variable Importance information they report; be sure to try modifying at least two different parameters

5) Optimize in turn for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Do the different model types do better at certain metrics? Is one model the best at every metric?
