1) Go to the UCI Data Science Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/

2) Find and download the "Adult Data Set" donated 1996-05-01, with 48842 data objects and 14 features. Download the .data, .test, and .names files.

3) Load the .data and .test files into R and use the .names file to assign column names to all the columns. Combine the .data and .test into one data frame. Cast categorical columns to factor and assign human-meaningful names to the levels if needed.

4) Write your new data frame out to "adult.csv", a comma delimited file containing all the data with column headers.

5) Using the plotting and exploration tools of your choice, pick three different subsets of 5 features. The subsets do not need to be completely distinct (i.e. feel free to reuse some columns)

6) Using those 3 sets, perform a 70/30 training/test split on the data and build 3 different decision trees (using rpart) on the training data, predicting the Income column.

7) Using print() and summary(), answer the following questions: Which of the features you chose were used most often in the decision trees? What does this tell you about the quality of the features you chose?
