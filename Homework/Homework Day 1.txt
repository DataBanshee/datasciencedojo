1) Go to the UCI Data Science Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/

2) Find and download the "Adult Data Set" donated 1996-05-01, with 48842 data objects and 14 features. Download the .data, .test, and .names files.

3) Load the .data and .test files into R and use the .names file to assign column names to all the columns. Combine the .data and .test into one data frame. Cast categorical columns to factor and assign human-meaningful names to the levels if needed.

4) Write your new data frame out to "adult.csv", a comma delimited file containing all the data with column headers.

5) Investigate the proportions of several categorical columns, including sex, marital-status, income, and two more of your choice.

6) Create density and box plots of age, education-num, and hours-per-week, using the graphics of your choice.

7) Now segment your box plots by the categorical variables you investigated in part 5. Are there any important differences in the segmented distributions?

8) Investigate particularly the segmentation based on income labels (>50k, <=50k). What columns do you think will be useful for predicting income? Do you think you should bin any of the continuous columns into categorical values?
